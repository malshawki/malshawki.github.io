I am a 

- senior researcher
- certified cybersecurity consultant and, 
- assistant professor

with a passion for designing secure and reliable protocols that underpin todayâ€™s distributed systems. I have: 

- **Ph.D. in Cybersecurity** from ELTE in collaboration with HFU
- **Diploma in IT Admin.** from TU Berlin
- **M.Sc. in Computer Science** from UoB

My work spans federated learning, network security, and applied cryptography, fields that sit at the core of safeguarding privacy, integrity, and trust in decentralized environments. 

### My research interest
I work at the intersection of security, distributed systems, and cryptography where protocols are complex, adversaries are imaginative, and bugs have a remarkable sense of timing. [website](https://alshawki.elte.hu).
